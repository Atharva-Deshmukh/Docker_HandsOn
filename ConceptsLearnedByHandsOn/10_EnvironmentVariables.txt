What are environment variables in general (not just Docker)?
------------------------------------------------------------

Environment variables are key–value pairs available to programs running in an operating system.

Examples on a normal OS:
    PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
    HOME=/home/user
    PORT=8080


Programs can read them to know configurations, credentials, settings, etc.

What are environment variables in Docker?
-----------------------------------------

A Docker container is like a small Linux system.
Inside it, programs can also read environment variables.

Environment variables inside a container work the SAME way as on your computer.

But the difference is: you control them at container runtime using:

-e KEY=value
--env KEY=value
an environment file (--env-file file.env)
Docker Compose environment: section

Example: docker run -e USERNAME=admin -e PASSWORD=secret myapp


Inside the container, the app can read:
USERNAME
PASSWORD

Docker doesn’t require them unless the image specifically expects them.

For example:
    MySQL requires a variable:
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=...


Because its ENTRYPOINT script checks for it.
But Nginx doesn’t need any environment variables to run.
So whether a variable is required depends on the app inside the container, not Docker itself.
