                                The problem Docker volumes solve
                                -------------------------------

Containers are temporary
    A Docker container is like a running instance of an image.
        You start a container → it runs
        You stop or delete the container → everything inside it is gone

Example:

A database container stores data in /var/lib/mysql. You delete the container. The database data disappears
This is by design. Containers are meant to be disposable.

Prefer data to be stored in volumes than a container since volumes are sharable across the containers.

                                What is a Docker volume?
                                ------------------------

A Docker volume is a persistent storage location that lives outside the container’s writable layer.
Multiple containers can share it.

                                Where do volumes live?
                                ----------------------

Docker stores volumes on the host machine, usually under: /var/lib/docker/volumes/

But:
    You don’t manage these directories manually
    Docker manages them for you


                        How volumes work (under the hood)
                        ---------------------------------

    You create a volume
    Docker creates a directory on the host
    You mount that directory into a container path
    Container reads/writes files
    Files actually live on the host

                                    Host Machine
                                    └── Docker Volume (folder)
                                        └── data.db

                                    Container
                                    └── /data
                                        └── data.db  (same file)
