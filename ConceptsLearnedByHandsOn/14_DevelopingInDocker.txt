Lets try to develop something in docker

We have a node app that has two routes defined, very simple one
It has two dependencies:
    mongo-db --> database app will use
    mongo-express --> interface for this DB

We don't want these dependencies inside our local system, we will use docker containers for it 

mongo-db image:

    this image has a port that comes with it, based on dockerhub details, port = 27017
    we will bind our own localhost to the same port, so we need to do little port binding here

    we will run this container in detached mode
    we will give this container a custom name

    Based on this file in dockerhub data for this image:

    Example compose.yaml for mongo:
        services:
        mongo:
            image: mongo
            restart: always
            environment:
            MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
            MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

    we need to pass these variables in environment compulsorily.

    we will directly run the container, image will be pulled automatically

    we need to pass many parameters in our docker run command, so we will break the line, 
    and on each line, we will pass individual parameters, for better readability.

        In Windows CMD (use ^ at line breaks)
        In PowerShell (use backtick ` at line breaks)
        In Linux/macOS (bash/zsh) (use \ at line breaks)

Similarly, pull the mongo-express image and run with similar envs
