docker run <image_name>

It checks if the image exists in local, if not, it pulls the latest version and runs it

C:\Users>docker run ubuntu

Docker gives random names to the containers, gives them unique ids.

Now, if we want to run container interactively, i.e. to access the container's terminal
command for this => docker run -it <image_name>   
it => interactively

Like, our system currently don't have linux, so linux commands won't work in local
But, in docker container we created above from ubuntu, we can run linux commands

docker run -it ubuntu  ==> Starts ubuntu container, and we enter the linux terminal Now
We can execute ls and mkdir commands there.

C:\Users>docker run -it ubuntu
root@25b599e0472c:/# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@25b599e0472c:/# mkdir AD_FOLDER
root@25b599e0472c:/# ls
AD_FOLDER  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@25b599e0472c:/# exit
